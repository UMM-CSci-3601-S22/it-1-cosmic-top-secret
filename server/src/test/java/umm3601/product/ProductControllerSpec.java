// The tests here include a ton of "magic numbers" (numeric constants).
// It wasn't clear to me that giving all of them names would actually
// help things. The fact that it wasn't obvious what to call some
// of them says a lot. Maybe what this ultimately means is that
// these tests can/should be restructured so the constants (there are
// also a lot of "magic strings" that Checkstyle doesn't actually
// flag as a problem) make more sense.
